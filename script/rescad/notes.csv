Pour les transaction étrangères les 50% du tarif officiel été également convenu. Aujourd'hui, Pictet informe que pour les transactions étranères, le rabais ne serait pas de 50% mais en peux moins. Ce tarifs serait en vigeur depuis le mois d'octobre 2010. Notre premier rendez-vous avec le client et Pictet a eu lieu au mois de novembre 2010. (Mauvais communication). 
En outre, je demande de confirmer par le client, si il avait reçu les avis en français, car RESCAD les reçoit en allemand. Pictet a confirme d'avoir corrigé ceci pour RESCAD (maintenant en français). De tous ces élément le client est informé et il prend note.

GH explique que cette baise a eu lieu à cause de la forte baisse des devises au mois de décember 2010, la hausse des rendements obligataires à travers du globe depuis le début du mois de novembre 2010 (depuis l'annonce du QE 2 de la Fed) et à cause de l'obligation commune de Madrid, qui a baissé jusqu'à 92.50% en décembre. Entretemps cette situation est moin tendue et elle s'est redréssée. Les devises sont à la hausse et l'obligation commune de Madrid est remonté à 97.50%. Dans l'ensemble le portefeuille a gagné 1% environ depuis le début de l'année 2011. Le client prend note et semble d'être satisfait avec ces explications. Je rappelle que le client ne veut seulement des obligations. Les actions dans le portefeuille vont être vendu progressivement. ","0"

Une correction pourrait être possible dans les mois que viennent. Le client confirme qu'il avait lu des commentaires dans la presse suisse allemanique et de ce fait comprend tout à fait ce positionnement. Le client informe que la banque Julius Baer a approché le client concernant ce portefeuille actions suisse et critiquait les frais de performance que nous débitons.

Cette revue de portefeuille se faisait après l'événement de la BNS du 15.01.2015. Le client ne tient plus compte de la situation au 31.12.2014. Il voie seulement la situation après le 15.01.2015 et il a peur que la Suisse va en récession. De ce fait, le marché des actions pourrait perdre d'avantage. Son relevé de titres au 25.01.2015 montre un valeur totale de CHF 497'000.00. Après 1 année et 8 mois il est plus-tôt déçu de ce résultat. GH essayait de lui expliquer que 20 mois sont relativement court pour juger l'évolution des actions. Le client n'a pas d'écoute et il veut diminuer les actions suisses de CHF 200'000.00 pour poursuivre avec un portefeuille actions suisses de CHF 300'000.00. Les autres 200'000.00 sont destiné à un nouveau portefeuille ""Actions Immobilier Suisse"" pour un montant final de CHF 300'000.00, géré par RESCAD SA. Gh rend attentif au fait, que les actions immobilier Suisses sont élevées et qu'elles pourraient baisser, après une amorcement des taux d'intérêts. GH informe que tous les fonds de pensions achètent pour le moment ce type de placement. Après un téléphone du 28.01.2015 avec le client et après référence du courriel, envoyé le 27.01.2015, avec des graphiques des actions immobilier Suisses, qui montrent les niveaux élevés des prix, le client est d'accord de constituer le portefeuille Immobilier Suisse d'une manière progressive, comme GH le propose. Par contre, la vente des actions pour un montant de CHF 200'000.00 est toujours souhaité par le client. Par ailleurs, le client déplore les frais élevé et qu'il avait compris que les performance fees seraient seulement à prendre, sur la surperformance par rapport au Benchmark. GH explique qu'il avait déjà annoncé ce sujet au client l'année passée et GH avait aussi expliqué que les performance fees étaient débité sur la fortune (absolute performance). Il est a ajouter que le client a signer le mandat de gestion, qui explique le mécanisme de la performance fee et le client reçoit tous les trimèstre un décompte avec tous les détails récapitulatifs. Client veut changer maintenant le tarif. GH propose que pour le moment et aussi longe temps que le portefeuille restera en dessous de la HWM, le tarif actuel de 0.30% serait pour lui plus avantageux que changer à un tarif de 1.00% flat fee maintenant. Le Client approuve cette proposition. 
Actions : RESCAD ouvre un nouveau compte/dépôt avec rubr."" Actions immobilier Suisse"". Le 29.01.2015 RESCAD vend des actions suisses pour un montant de CHF 200'000.00 qui sont versé sur le nouveau compte ""Immobilier Suisse"". Frais de gestion pour ce nouveau compte: 1% frais de base, sans performance fees. Client a accepté ce tarif.  GH/28.01.2015 ","0"

Th. Montant. Durant la discussion, nous avons la confirmation que la stratégie demandée est toujours d'actualité, à savoir : 70% min. résidentiel et un minimum d'exposition à la région lémanique. Au 31.10.16, il y avait 66.90% de résidentiel, 3.43% résidentiel mixte et 29.67% commercial et pour les régions : 5.81% Genève, 11.24% Romandie et le reste en Suisse alémanique.

Bien que la stratégie soit confirmée  par M. Montant, nous lui avons fait remarquer que cela ne pouvait se faire sans éviter une concentration dans les titres, ex. UBS ANFOS 31.21% et Swissancanto IFCA 31.05%, ceci est accepté par le client. 

Différentes alternatives ont été présentées afin de démontrer que le rajout et-ou échange (CS SIAT, UBS SIMA) de positions n'allaient pas améliorer le cadre donné, bien compris par M. Montant.

Le % souhaité sur Fundamenta / FREN, n'est toujours pas atteint (liquidité + prix), une alternative comme SF Sustainable / SFPF a été présentée mais pas retenue pour le moment.

Après revue des positions et du point expliqué sur la concentration, globalement la CPP privilégie actuellement la liquidité + qualité des titres au détriment de sociétés bien plus petites avec un manque de liquidité et d'historique.

Messieurs,
Rescad, notre conseiller en matière d’immobilier indirect suisses, nous a signalé que le fonds SFP Sustainable Proporties a modifié sa politique d’investissement notamment pour s’étendre en suisse romande.
A noter, que ce fonds avait déjà procédé à des investissements au Tessin que nous n’avions pas jugé très favorable.
Compte tenu de cette situation, de la future perte de diversification et des doutes sur la stratégie suivie, il a été décidé de vendre cette position progressivement en profitant de la +/value actuel.
Rescad a parallèlement été chargé de nous proposer un autre investissement en remplacement.
A suivre !
Très bonne fin de journée

Email du 13.11.2019

Messieurs,
Rescad, notre conseiller en matière d’immobilier indirect suisses, nous a signalé que le fonds SFP Sustainable Proporties a modifié sa politique d’investissement notamment pour s’étendre en suisse romande.
A noter, que ce fonds avait déjà procédé à des investissements au Tessin que nous n’avions pas jugé très favorable.
Compte tenu de cette situation, de la future perte de diversification et des doutes sur la stratégie suivie, il a été décidé de vendre cette position progressivement en profitant de la +/value actuel.
Rescad a parallèlement été chargé de nous proposer un autre investissement en remplacement.
A suivre !
Très bonne fin de journée

Email du 11.12.2019

Cher Monsieur,
Merci pour ces mises à jour.
Finalement, la commission de placement, vu les performances réalisées en 2019, a décidé de ne pas faire de réinvestissements pour le moment.
Nous pourrons reprendre nos discussions l’année prochaine ou en cas de corrections sur les marchés.
D’ici là, je vous souhaite ainsi qu’à vos proches de belles Fêtes de fin d’année et que 2020 vous apporte joie et réussite.
Bien à vous

Premièrement: Suite à la demande du 03.05.2022 concernant le versement du montant de CHF 106'000.00. Le CS n'a pas exécuté l'ordre de paiement, dû au nantissement du dépôt de titres et du compte privé, suite à l'acceptation de porter garant pour la relation Mathieu Bally et Clément Carlucci (fils et beau-fils de Monsieur Bally). Les deux enfants ont repris chaqu'un deux hypothèques du même montant sur des appartements à Fechy (MB) et Denens (CC). Le client ne se souvient plus de ces engagement et rend GH responsable de ne pas de défendre les intérêts du client. 
Deuxièmement: Le CS informe RESCAD le 30 mai et le 01 juin (visioconférence GH, AB RESCAD et MZC et VV du CS) que le taux fixe sur une hypothèque, échéance 03.06.2031 à 1.50% de Clément Carlucci et sur l'hypothèque, échéance 29.09.2031 à 1.50% de Mathieu Bally ne seront plus maintenu par le CS et demande que RESCAD informe les clients d'une augmentation à un taux approximatif de 1.84% MB et 1.90% CC, suite à l'évaluation individuelle du rating client des deux enfants. GH informe le client le 02.06.2022. Client n'accepte pas cette démarche et insiste sur les conditions de 1.5% pour les deux hypothèques des enfants, en reprochant que RESCAD ne défend pas les intérêts de la famille. 
Suite aux transferts des hypothèques aux enfants, le client demande depuis le 20 mai un extourne des intérêts calculés jusqu'au 31.03.2022 et payés par le client sur les hypothèques Fechy et Denens. GH demand depuis le 20 mai un calcul claire de la part du CS et une proposition de refacturation des enfants à partir du 14.02.2022. Pour l'instant GH n'a pas reçu tous les éléments, permettant d'obtenir une situation claire.
Le client revient sur le nantissement du compte titres. GH informe que le client avait signer le contrat cadre du crédit hypothécaire pour les deux enfants. Dans ce document il a été rendu attentif à ce nantissement que du fait que le montant nanti a été moins élevé, selon les usages de la banque. Le client agresse GH en disant qu'il disait n'importe que et qu'il ne défendait pas les intérêt du client. En outre, client ne veut plus que RESCAD entreprend des investissements.
Troisièmement: 
Le client a vendu la maison de St Prex au cours du mois de mai. Quant au calcul de la compensation des la terminaison anticipé des hypothèques à taux fixe, il a été furieux de devoir attendre le calcul exacte de ces montant que le notaire n'avait pas reçu le matin de la signature de l'acte de vente auprès du notaire. GH a du intervenir auprès de la banque pour qu'elle fasse le nécessaire. 
Le 24.05.2022, GF rend attentif GH que le compte prive des intérêts Saint Prex deviendra débiteur du montant de CHF 21'500.98, dû aux débits des montant de pénalités des terminaisons anticipées des hypothèques à taux fixe. Le 25.05.2022 au matin, GH appelle le client sans succes. Vers 12h00 GH envoie un SMS au client en lui informant qu'il avait couvert le compte intérêts Saint Prex par le débit du compte titres avec bonne valeur du 24.05.2022. Vers 16h00 le client appelle GH. GH informe qu'il avait pris l'initiative de couvrir se compte intérêts St Prex. C'est là où le client informe GH que son notaire versera la somme nécessaire pour couvrir ces soldes. GH répond qu'il n'y aura aucun problème. GH pourrait recréditer le compte titres avec le même montant, avec même date de valeur. 
Cependant, le versement du notaire (ou du client lui même) avait été exécuté seulement le 30 mai, avec valeur 24.05. GH et ces collègues ne pouvaient pas voir ces transactions avant le 30.05.2022. 
GH demande au CS tous les relevés de comptes hypothécaires depuis le 01.01.2022 pour le client. 
Le 03.06.2022, GH envoie un e-mail avec un résumé de la situation actuelle. Gh/03.06.2022","0"

GH informe sur la situation des marchés financiers et commente position par position. Son analyse inclue également les liquidités très élevées, mais voulu par le client. La performance est en dessous du potentiel, dû à ce montant de liquidités. Il recommande au moins de les placer en 48h. Le client accepte le placement en 48h, mais ne veux pas investir d'avantage en actions et obligations à ce moment. Le client veut faire des donations aux enfants. 
En outre, le client informe que l'immeuble à Thônex est mis en vente par la régie SPG. Le client manifeste malgré tout quelques doutes. Le prix est inférieur au celui estimé il y a 1 année en arrière. GH informe que cela lui semble logique dû au fait que les taux d'intérêts ont augmenté depuis. Le client a un peu peur de la volatilité des marchés financiers et se semble plus en sécurité avec un immeuble. Pour GH le discours depuis une année change en peu mais le plus important reste que le client se sent à l'aise et qu'il ne se sente pas bousculé. Le client est d'accord que GH montre le dossier à une caisse de pensions. Affaire à suivre. Gh/22.12.2023
